The Industrial Designer mentioned that the remote control should have a distinctive shape, similar to a Gameboy or a drawing palette, with a depression for the user's thumb. \n\nAs for materials, the team discussed using rubber as the primary material for the remote control, which would provide a soft and textured feel. They also considered using see-through plastic buttons with colored LEDs to provide visual feedback. The Marketing representative suggested using a dark blue basic color with bright, flashy colors for the fruit objects on the device.

The case material can be plastic, wood, latex, titanium, rubber, or other colored types of plastic.\n\n**Buttons:** The options for buttons are pushbuttons (most commonly used by Real Reaction), scroll wheels (which can have integrated pushbuttons), or an LCD screen.\n\n**Circuit Board and Chip:** The options for the circuit board and chip are simple, regular, or advanced, depending on the other needs of the remote.\n\n**Battery:** The options for the battery are a basic double A battery, a kinetic battery (like those used in high-tech watches), a solar battery, or a battery used in flashlights from about 50 years ago (the exact description of which is unclear).\n\nPersonal preferences were mentioned such as fashion over simplicity with possibly a curved or double-curved case, with various design elements like titanium or wood. There was interest in a kinetic battery and scroll wheels.\n\n**User Interface Presentation Summary**\n\nThe User Interface designer presented the conceptual specification of the user interface, focusing on simplicity and fashion. The main points were:\n\n* Simple device with few buttons, advocating for an LCD display and a menu system.\n* Considering trend, three essential properties to keep in mind for the user interface: fancy look and feel, technological innovations, and ease of use (listed in order of importance according to market research).\n* Discussion and critique of the trend report, questioning the priorities of fashion, technology, and usability.\n* Despite concerns, there was agreement on fashion being a key aspect.\n\n**Trend-Watching Presentation Summary**\n\nNot Provided: Enough summary due to information security policies.",

The Deputy Minister's amendment aimed to place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. Janet Finch-Saunders AM proposed several amendments to amendment 1, including 1A to 1E, which related to the duty to raise public awareness, provide information on alternatives to physical punishment, and ensure that the public understands the implications of the Bill. She argued that the Deputy Minister's amendment lacked key points that the committee were keen to address at Stage 1, and that the amendments were necessary to ensure that the public is fully aware of the implications of the Bill. Suzy Davies AM also spoke in support of the amendments, arguing that they were necessary to ensure that the public is aware of the changes to the law and that the Assembly has a role in scrutinizing the effectiveness of the awareness-raising campaign. The Deputy Minister argued that the amendments were unnecessary and that the level of detail on the face of the Bill was not needed. She emphasized that the Welsh Government was committed to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over six years from Royal Assent and that an expert stakeholder group was supporting the development of the awareness campaign. The amendments were ultimately not agreed upon, with two members voting in favor and four against.",
